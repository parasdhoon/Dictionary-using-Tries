This project implements a dictionary application using the Trie data structure in C++. The application supports efficient word insertion, search, and auto-completion functionalities, making it a useful tool for managing large sets of words.
## Tech Stack
* C++
*  Standard Template Library (STL)
* GCC/G++
* Visual Studio Code
## Features
* Efficient Word Insertion: Insert words into the trie structure with optimal time complexity.
* Word Search: Search for words quickly using the trie structure.
* Auto-Completion: Suggest possible words based on given prefixes, making it easier to find words.
##  Prerequisites
* C++ compiler (GCC/G++ or any other standard C++ compiler).
* Visual Studio Code or any other preferred IDE/editor.
